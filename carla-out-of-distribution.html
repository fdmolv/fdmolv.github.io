<h1> CARLA videos on Town01 vs Town02 (out-of-distribution) </h1>

<h3>Description</h3>
<h4>
Comparison of CARLA video completions on the held-out, in-distribution Town01 set (left array) and on out-of-distribution Town02 videos (right array). 

Each starts from the first 36 frames of a test video. Within each block each column shows completions for a different test video. The top row is the ground-truth and all other rows are sampled completions. Observed frames are marked with a red border.
