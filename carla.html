<h1> CARLA Town01 </h1>

<h3>Description</h3>
<h4>
Example completions, starting from the first 36 frames of a test video. Within each block each column shows completions for a different test video. The top row is the ground-truth and all other rows are sampled completions. Observed frames are marked with a red border, and the end of he video is marked with a checkerboard pattern.
</h4>

  <h3>Discussion</h3>
<h4>
Samples from FDM with Autoreg show no movement a large proportion of the time. This is a similar failure mode to that shown for the Long-range sampling scheme in Figure 6, and explains the bad WD score in Table 1.
Samples from FDM with Hierarchy-2 exhibit occasional "flickers", where frames generated in the first stage of the sampling scheme are not aligned with neighbouring frames generated in later stages (explaining the relatively bad OP score). They are otherwise fairly realistic (explaining their relatively good WD and FVD scores).
As seen in the other datasets, samples from CWVAE are much blurrier than those from FDM or VDM.
